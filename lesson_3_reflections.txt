Ref 1:
A remote repository is better than a local repository
when you are working either with a group of people 
or when you may be working on different computers (home computer, work computer, etc).

Ref 2:
Sometimes you may wish to work on a specific piece of code,
not the most up-to-date version. 

Ref 3:
A fork is a clone that is set up on github. Clones from github 
to your github. No work done on local machine

A clone is just a copy of a repository. You can clone from github
or your machine, but you cannot clone to github.

A branch is a commit (and its parents). 

Ref 4:
Benefit is that you are working on the most up-to-date code. Also,
if needed, you can revert back to that state.

Ref 5:
Without using github, you would have to do a lot more emailing
and manually keep track of the latest files. 
However, there is a downside: github requires that all 
collaborators know how to use it and it can take some time to learn
