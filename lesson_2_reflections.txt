Needs to be done to enable all the git features

Ref 2:
Staging area acts as a buffer between the working
directory and the repository. Instead of committing all

you can stage only the relevant ones first and then commit them

Ref 3:

Ref 4:
Branches are helpful in keeping the history because they are
named, which allows you to understand what each branch does

Ref 5:
Diagrams help you picture the different branches, especially
the reachability. Branches are hard to visualize by just looking
at different commits
