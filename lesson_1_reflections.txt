Using diff helped me see the differences
between two long files that otherwise
would have been very difficult. 

command was diff -u oldfile newfile




ref 2:
seeing the history will allow you to 
roll back to older versions of the file. 

ref 3:
pros: more control, less trash versions
cons: prone to human error - could forget


ref 4:
because git is more useful for code, which often has files 
that depend on each other


ref 5: 
git log shows you each individual commit, with timestamp,
description and id
git diff can be used to compare two different commits
using their id (from git log)


ref 6: 
version control gives you a safety net.. you are more 
confident to make changes that could break something
because you know you can always revert to an older (working) version


ref 7:
I would like to use git for android development or any other
programming fun
